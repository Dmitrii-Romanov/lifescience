In this release the license change was made. Ketcher version 2 is available via Apache License v2. We have been moving to this step for a long time. The new license should allow for Ketcher to be used in more products and utilities. We continue support and develop new features. We look forward receiving new reports and notes to improve the structure editor together.

* Rewritten core engine with ES5 standard and new Javascript libraries
* New interface with modern icons and windows. User interface was ported to Redux

* Calculating CIP for structures
* Name to structure was added into the structure loader
* Calculating properties functionality

* Many others fixes and updates...
