Summary

Ketcher version 2 now available at EPAM Github

https://github.com/epam/ketcher

In this release the license change was made. Ketcher version 2 is available via Apache License v2. We have been moving to this step for a long time. The new license should allow for Ketcher to be used in more products and utilities. We continue support and develop new features. We look forward receiving new reports and notes to improve the structure editor together.
