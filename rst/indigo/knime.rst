Nodes for KNIME
===============

Since May 2011, Indigo team provides cheminformatics nodes for KNIME. The overview of the nodes is
available at `KNIME Tech <http://tech.knime.org/community/indigo>`__.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you need to add the `KNIME update
site <http://update.knime.org/analytics-platform/3.3/>`__ into your "software sites"
list, if it is not already there
(`instructions <http://www.knime.org/downloads/update>`__). From that
site, you need to download the *Base Chemistry Types & Nodes* (needed
for the Indigo nodes to work) and the *Distance Matrix* (needed for one
of the provided Indigo examples to work).
