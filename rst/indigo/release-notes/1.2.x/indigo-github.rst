Source Code

We have moved our development into GitHub. 

https://github.com/epam/Indigo

It already contains lot of changes since last release. Please be informed the following items:

* Now all the development is done in GitHub. 
* There is a mechanism called ``Issues`` available on GitHub which is used by Indigo. Right now it has not many tickets, but soon we will move our big ``TODO`` list into this section. One can easily create an issue and see a progress
* All the packages (Java, C#, Utilities) now under **EPAM** brand ("com.epam.*" package)
* Tests were moved into additional private repository, because it contains proprietary molecular structures.
* Code was cleaned up. License was updated.
